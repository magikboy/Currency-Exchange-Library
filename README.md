## üîß Supply Chain Simulation Setup

### Step 1: Fork the target repository with timer (20 minutes)

For educational and research purposes, this repository can be used to simulate supply chain vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. 

**‚è∞ Time Limit: 20 minutes** - This step should be completed within 20 minutes to simulate real-world attack scenarios where attackers have limited time windows.

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone the forked repository locally
3. Set up the Docker environment using the provided `docker-compose.yml`
4. Verify the base currency exchange functionality works correctly

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Currency-Exchange-Library.git
cd Currency-Exchange-Library

# Start the simulation environment
docker-compose up -d

# Verify base functionality
docker-compose exec backdoor-simulation python currency_exchange.py
```

**Note**: This simulation is intended for educational purposes only and should be run in isolated, controlled environments.

## üì¶ Installation
